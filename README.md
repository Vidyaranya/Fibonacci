<b>Overview:</b><br><br>
This repository contains programs to calculate the sum of the even fibonacci numbers in the first 
n terms of the series. It is done in two ways: iterative version and O(1) version. Please look below
on how to run the programs and the logic behind them.

<b>Running the program:</b>
1. Go the directory containing the makefile and run the command 'make'.
2. Run ./fibonacci to run the iterative version
3. Run ./fibonacci_advanced to run the O(1) version

<b>Calculate the sum of the even fibonacci numbers in the first n terms of the series:</b><br><br>
Observe that every third fibonacci number is even.
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ,â€¦ 

So try to write Fn in terms of Fn-3 and Fn-6 <br>
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 <br>
   = Fn-2 + Fn-3 + Fn-3 + Fn-4 <br>
   = Fn-2 + 2Fn-3 + Fn-4 <br>
   = Fn-3 + Fn-4 + 2Fn-3 + Fn-4 <br>
   = 3Fn-3 + 2Fn-4 <br>
   = 4Fn-3 + Fn-6  <br>
   
Calculate the appropriate number of even numbers and use the above formula to sum them up.

<b>Calculate the sum of the even fibonacci numbers in the first n terms of the series in O(1):</b>

Again using the fact that every third number is even, the sum of even fibonacci numbers can be written as sum of <br>
((phi)<sup>3i</sup> - (psi)<sup>3i</sup>)/5<sup>1/2</sup> <br>
where 'i' is the number of even fibonacci numbers for which we want to find the sum.<br>
phi is (1+5<sup>1/2</sup>)/2 and psi = phi<sup>-1</sup>
<br>Solving the above gives (1 / sqrt(5)) * (
        phi<sup>3</sup> * ((1 - phi<sup>3k</sup>) / (1 - phi<sup>3</sup>)) -
        psi<sup>3</sup> * ((1 - psi<sup>3k</sup>) / (1 - psi<sup>3</sup>)))<br>
where k is floor(n/3)
